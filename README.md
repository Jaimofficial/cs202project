## Introduction

Welcome to the **Checkers Game in C++**, a console-based application developed as the final capstone project for **CS202 Data Structures and Algorithms 1**. This project showcases the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms to create a fully functional Checkers game, emphasizing clean code, efficient algorithms, and user-friendly interactions.

## Features

## Installation 


## Prerequisites

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/checkers-game-cpp.git
   
## Usage
You can run the program by doing:
1. Navigate terminal to directory “cs202project”

2. Run ```bash
         make```


3. Run ```bash ./checkers```

The rest is fairly self explanatory:

4. Enter if you want to play against an automated player. 

If not:

5. Black moves first, enter the checker you want to move (“X Y”) where X is the row and Y is the column. X and Y should be integers between 0 and 7 inclusive.

6. Enter where you want to move the piece (“X Y”).

7. Red’s turn. Do the last two steps but with a red piece. 

8. Continue until there is a winner. 

9. When there is a winner, you will be asked if you want to play another game (y/n).

11. If y, repeat from step 6.

12. If n, the program terminates. 

13. After this, you can run "make test" to test the gradescripts.
