Project with Hien and Tom

Checkers game

How to play:

Navigate terminal to directory “cs202project”

Run “rm ./checkers” 

Run “make”

Run “./checkers”

The rest is fairly self explanatory:

Black moves first, enter the checker you want to move (“X Y”) where X is the row and Y is the column. X and Y should be integers between 0 and 7 inclusive.

Enter where you want to move the piece (“X Y”).

Red’s turn. Do the last two steps but with a red piece. 

Continue until there is a winner. 

When there is a winner, you will be asked if you want to play another game (y/n).

If y, repeat from step 5.

If n, the program terminates.
